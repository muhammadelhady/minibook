	\chapter*{Preface}
	with the growth of the new technology on the internet all the companies works on making all their apps available on the internet with a new technique making them available in very wide range all over the world this technique called the cloud computing.
	\newline
	cloud computing is kind of computing based on internet to providing sharing resources between users based on their demand it`s provide computing resources and storage to users and enterprises with change of capabilities to process and store the data.
	\newline
	the data centers may be too far away from the users or enterprise that use the cloud could be countries or even across all the world and they just need a internet connection to make access on it and use it to finish their tasks on it in very easy and efficient way.
	\newline
	the growth in cloud computing field is very fast, well widespread and big competitive in that field led to the low coast resources and storage and it's become highly demand in the global market cause it`s avoid the enterprise infrastructure costs ( e.g data centers and servers )    and enable the enterprise to just focus on their core bussiness without wasting their time and resources on infrastructure.

    \chapter{History of cloud computing}
    
    
    when we say cloud computing you think that cloud computing is from 21st century ,but that's not true at all the cloud computing concept existed in 1950s with mainframes computers where multiple users able to access on the same central computer through dumb terminals which just one of many views to access to the mainframe computer, cause that was not practice to every enterprise to buy or maintain a computer for every one of the company employees 
  \newline
  \newline
  \newline
    in 1970 virtual machines concept was invented and using it become easy to execute more than one operating system concurrency at the same time and the same hardware with its own isolated environment, virtual can execute inside one hardware and can run completely different OS at the same time
